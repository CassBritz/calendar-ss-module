# Silverstripe Events and Calendar Module
## Overview
This module provides a Calendar pagetype for Silverstripe that allows for multiple events to be created/managed, as well as events pulled in from Google Calendar.

## Notice
Please note this module has only been tested with SS v2.4+, *not* including v3.0.

## Thanks
This module uses Adam Shaw's awesome [Full Calendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) module, which takes care of most of the frontend display of the 'Calendar' view for all events.
